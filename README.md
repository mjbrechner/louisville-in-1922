Project Plan: Louisville in 1922
Designed by: M.J. Brechner

This website will showcase local newspaper articles from the year 1922. Upon loading the site, the user will be presented with a "This Day in History" article in which an article from 1922 corresponding to the current day and month will be loaded.

The project will include the following CSS features: (1) a navigation menu that expands and collapses, and (2) content organized with Flexbox based on mobile/tablet/desktop views.

The project will also contain the following JavaScript features: (1) a function that performs a mathematical operation - calculating the number of years between 1922 and the user's current year (See: date.js); and (2) a JavaScript array and/or objects with contents displayed on the page (See: articles.js and grab-articles.js); and (3) the creation, setting, and displaying of at least three variables (day, monthName, yearsSince1922, artDateIdentifier, artContents).
