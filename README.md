Project Plan: Louisville in 1922
Designed by: M.J. Brechner

This website will showcase local newspaper articles from the year 1922. Upon loading the site, the user will be presented with a "This Day in History" article in which an article from 1992 corresponding to the current day and month will be loaded.

The project will include the following CSS features: (1) a navigation menu that expands and collapses, and (2) content organized with Flexbox and/or Grid based on mobile/tablet/desktop views; and the following JavaScript features: (1) a function that performs a mathematical operation (calculating the number of years between 1922 and the user's current year), and (2) a JavaScript array with contents (the daily newspaper headlines and articles) displayed on the page.
