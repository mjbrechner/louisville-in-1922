Project Plan: Louisville in 1922
Designed by: M.J. Brechner

This website will showcase local newspaper articles from the year 1922. Upon loading the site, the user will be presented with a "This Day in History" article corresponding to a 1922 headline based on the current day and month. Users will be able to manually select articles from other days of the year as well.

The project will include the following features: (1) a navigation menu that expands and collapses; (2) content organized with Flexbox and/or Grid based on mobile/tablet/desktop views; (3) a JavaScript function that performs a mathematical operation (to wit, the number of years between 1922 and the user's current year); and (4) a JavaScript array with contents (the daily newspaper headlines and articles) displayed on the page.
